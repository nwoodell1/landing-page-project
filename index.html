            <p class="insetinfo">This website is designed to help you find search engines, which will help you find whatever it is you need. Therefore, this is probably the most useful website on the internet. I'm just saying. I'm definitely the best.</p>

                <p> A lot of people like DuckDuckGo because they think its not tracking them. I just assume I'm being tracked every time I touch a computer.</p>

            <div class="yahoo">
                <a href="http://www.yahoo.com" target="_blank"><img src="./images/yahoologo.jpg" alt="yahoo logo" style="height: 200px; width: 200px;"></a>
                <p>Yahoo is super old school. Kinda sucks these days, but they do have a thriving business in finance news now, weirdly.</p>

                <p>Ask Jeeves was my favorite when I was a kid. It used to have a logo of a little butler guy named Jeeves, and you asked him questions. Good times. Life was simple then.</p>

                <p>Google is the biggest name on the internet now. They're the best. Their motto used to be, "don't be evil" and now its not. I think thats telling. But you're kinda forced to do business with them now.</p>

        <p class="quote">Search engines are super important and I made the worst one. It was called Bing. The person who made this website knows which search engine to use though. You should ask them what their favorite is.</p>
